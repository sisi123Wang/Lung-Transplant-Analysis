# Lung-Transplant-Analysis
This project is to test what degree does anemia, hypoxia, hypotension, and pre-existing kidney disease affect the incidence of AKI, need for dialysis at discharge, and mortality.

1. The baseline one-row-per-patient data with AKI + outcomes.

2. Table 1 (baseline by AKI)
3. Table 2 (outcomes by AKI stage) to understand distributions.
4. LASSO to screen among pre-transplant/intra-op predictors for each endpoint.

Primary models: Prespecified clinical covariates plus any LASSO-selected predictors.
